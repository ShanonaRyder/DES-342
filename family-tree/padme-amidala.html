        <h1>Padmé Amidala</h1>
        <h2>Time of death: 19 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin) - <br class="mobile-break"> Place of death: Coruscant</h2>
        <p>Padmé Naberrie was born on the planet of Naboo in 46 BBY. She was elected queen at the age of 14 and adopted the royal name “Amidala” After her reign she became a senator, 
            representing the people of Naboo during the final years of the Galactic Republic. She and Jedi Padawan Anakin Skywalker began a secret relationship and soon married on her 
            home planet.
        </p>
        <p>Several years later, she revealed to her husband that she was pregnant. After he received a vision of her dying in childbirth, Anakin turned to the dark side of the Force in 
            an attempt to prevent it. After a whole lot of dramatic yelling and fighting, Padmé gave birth to twins Luke and Leia before apparently dying of a broken heart after seeing 
            her husband so evil.
