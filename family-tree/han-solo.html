      <h2>Time of death: 34 ABY (After the Battle of Yavin)- <br class="mobile-break" />
        Place of death: Starkiller Base</h2>
      <p>Han Solo was a smuggler from Corellia employed by crime lord Jabba the Hunt during the time of the Galactic Empire. After ditching a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with said 
        mpire, he found himself owing Jabba a large sum of money. His luck seemed to turn around however when Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi hired him as a pilot to charter them and their 
        droids to Alderaan aboard his prized ship, the Millennium Falcon. Many issues arose along the way and he ended up getting caught up in the rebellion against the Empire, falling in 
        love with Princess Leia Organa and having a son with her.</p>
      <p>In 34 ABY (Episode VIII) Han aided the Rebels in a battle to destroy the First Order superweapon known as Starkiller Base. During the fight, he caught sight of the Supreme Leader of 
        the First Order, his and Leia’s son Ben, now known as Kylo Ren after his fall to the dark side. Han tried to appeal to his son’s humanity and convince Ben to return home with him but 
        instead, Kylo Ren stabbed his father in the gut with his lightsaber and watched as he fell over the edge of the gangway into a vast abyss.</p>
