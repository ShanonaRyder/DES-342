      <h1>Shmi Skywalker</h1>
      <h2>Time of death: 22 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin) - <br class="mobile-break"> 
        Place of death: Tatooine</h2>
      <p>Shmi Skywalker lived on the planet of Tatooine as a slave for the Toydarian junk dealer, Watto, during the last years of the Galactic Republic. She gave birth to her son, 
        Anakin Skywalker, in 41 BBY and sent him to train as a Jedi after he was discovered by Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn, several years later. Some time after her son’s departure, 
        Shmi was sold to Cliegg Lars, a man she later married, and his son Owen. </p>
      <p>In 22 BBY (Episode II), Shmi was captured and tortured by a group of Tusken Raiders. Her son, now a Jedi Padawan, returned to Tatooine in an attempt to save her after having 
        nightmares of her impending demise but he, unfortunately, was too late. Shmi died in Anakin’s arms after a heartfelt goodbye expressing how proud she was to see him all grown up.</p>
